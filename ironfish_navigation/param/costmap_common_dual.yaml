transform_tolerance: 1.5
#Specifies the delay in transform (tf) data that is tolerable in seconds. This parameter serves as a safeguard to losing a link in the tf tree while still allowing an amount of latency the user is comfortable with to exist in the system. For example, a transform being 0.2 seconds out-of-date may be tolerable, but a transform being 8 seconds out of date is not. If the tf transform between the coordinate frames specified by the global_frame and robot_base_frame parameters is transform_tolerance seconds older than ros::Time::now(), then the navigation stack will stop the robot.

obstacle_range: 4.0 #localcostmap 8.0/2
#determines the maximum range sensor reading that will result in an obstacle being put into the costmap.
raytrace_range: 4.0 #localcostmap 8.0/2
# means that the robot will attempt to clear out space in front of it up to 4.0 meters away given a sensor reading.

inflation:
    inflation_radius: 1.30 #According to corridor 2.538/2 m
    #The radius in meters to which the map inflates obstacle cost values.
    cost_scaling_factor: 2.58
    #A scaling factor to apply to cost values during inflation.
    #The cost function is computed as follows for all cells in the costmap
    #further than the inscribed radius distance and closer than the inflation radius distance away from an actual obstacle:
    #exp(-1.0 * cost_scaling_factor * (distance_from_obstacle - inscribed_radius)) * (costmap_2d::INSCRIBED_INFLATED_OBSTACLE - 1),
    #where costmap_2d::INSCRIBED_INFLATED_OBSTACLE is currently 254.
    #NOTE: since the cost_scaling_factor is multiplied by a negative in the formula,
    #increasing the factor will decrease the resulting cost values.
