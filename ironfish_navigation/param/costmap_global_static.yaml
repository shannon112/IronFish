  # parameters set the width (meters), height (meters), and resolution (meters/cell) of the costmap.
  # Note that its fine for the resolution of this grid to be different than the resolution of your static map,
  # but most of the time we tend to set them equally.

  static_map: true
  # If you aren't using an existing map or map server,
  # set the static_map parameter to false.

  rolling_window: false
  # parameter to true means that the costmap will remain centered around the robot as the robot moves through the world.
